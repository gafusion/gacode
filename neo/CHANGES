Version 0.1

- Initial stable version of NEO using Chebyshev spectral 
  energy discretization.
- Fully operable with INPUT and (optionally) INPUT_profiles 
  for experimental profiles.

Version 0.2

- Added tools/input, along with simdir generation facility
  (use neo -g).
- make system integrated with GYRO.
- Full toroidal rotation effects added.

Version 0.3 (6 July 2009)

- Added new neo_interface code (together with Wiki documentation). 
- Added Epar0 (inductive electric field) as an input and updated 
  HH theory and the Sauter model.
- Added zmag for Miller geometry and general geometry for experimental 
  profiles.
- Added error checking for matrix solve.
- Assume positive B_ref for experimental profiles.
- Updated equilibrium to work with new gyro GEO library.
- Fixed bug in endpt derivative for Chebyshev polynomials
- Fixed bug in parser for non-existent INPUT file.
- Fixed bug in experimental_profiles -- grad_r from GEO is 
  NAN at r=0 -- set dphi0/dr to be 0 there.
- Fixed bug in HH theory A1e formula.

Version 0.4 (4 December 2009)

- For experimental profiles, removed the assumption that the first species 
  is deuterium; now it can be any species, but it is still the normalizing
  species for the outputs.
- Added computation of the gyro-viscous fluxes.
- Added Hirshman-Sigmar theory parameters to neo interface output.
- Added output for theta variation of the flows, including up-down asymmetry
  effects.
- Uses the new EXPRO_w0 and EXPRO_w0p from GYRO to determine the rotation
  frequency.
- Added output of the zero-th order toroidal and parallel flows.
- Fixed bug in def of s-alpha B_poloidal.
- added line
- Fixed bug of missing dR/dr term for finite rotation dlnN/dr.
