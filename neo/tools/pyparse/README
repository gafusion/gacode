These were written by Scott Kruger and Eric Held as part of
the NEO benchmark.  They could probably be cleaned up a bit,
but they work well enough and should be easy to understand.

Dependencies: matplotlib, numpy, mpmath 

mpmath provides the polynomials required to reconstruct the
distribution function from neo.  It is easily googleable and
built.
