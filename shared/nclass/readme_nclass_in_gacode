This version of NCLASS is from the NTCC Modules Library:
http://w3.pppl.gov/rib/repositories/NTCC/catalog/Asset/nclass.html

The following necessary modifications were needed:
 
1) 05/20/2013, by EAB: pamx_mz.inc
   mx_mz=18 was changed to mx_mz=50 to allow for higher Z calcuations

2) 05/21/2013, by EAB: nclass_mod.f
   The calculation of the electrical resistivity p_etap (line 753) was 
   changed to prevent division by zero in the case that Epar=0:
   Original: 
      p_etap=p_eb/p_ohjb
   Change:
      IF(p_ohjb == 0.) THEN
         p_etap = 0.0
      ELSE
         p_etap=p_eb/p_ohjb
      ENDIF
