   Purpose:
     This is to enable the writing of VisSchema compliant
     HDF5 data.  Here I am taking the relevant file from 
     the Tech-X fciowrappers library.

   Background:
     HDF5 has many features that make it a worthwhile data format:
       - Cross-platform binary format
       - Flexible data layout
       - Parallel I/O if you go through the trouble of doing so
       - Good tool support, including the very excellent Tables
         python module
       - A lot of work has been done on providing high performance
         writing at the disk level, and this work continues on
         supercomputing systems.
      The bad things about HDF5 are:
       - The build process can be a pain, although this has improved
         significantly as of the 1.6 series.
       - The calls are generally low-level which is inconvenient
         and somewhat bewildering to use because of the terminology
         used by the HDF5 team.
       - It is so flexible that there is no guarantee that your HDF5
         file can be read by a visualization package that "supports
         HDF5".  

      The last reason motivated the development of the VisSchema format
      which is a way of marking up the HDF5 data using attributes that
      tells the visualization reader how to interpret the data.  At the
      simplest level, it tells the reader that this variable is
      associated with that grid.  More details can be found at the
      VizSchema website:

    Implementation:
      hdf5_fcapi.f: 
        the layer that sits just on top of HDF5 and makes it easy to do
        things like open files and dump arrays (which in itself requires
        multiple calls to HDF5).
