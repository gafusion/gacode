Files
----------
IterDB Parser:
      getIterDbData.py
          front end to the files in fileconvertors.  For ipython
          use, you might want to import readIterDB
          Note: This file has the capability of interpolating onto
            grids from facets pre files.  We did not add the
            dependencies to enable this type of example, but the
            code is left in to show how it can be done for other folks.
      readIterDB.py
          Main parser
      iterDBsemanticMap.py
      iterDBsemanticMap.pyc
          This maps the iterDB fields into variable names for
          convenience.
