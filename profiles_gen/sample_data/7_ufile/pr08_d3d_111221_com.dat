Tokamak: D3D
Contact person: M. Murakami / C.M. Greenfield
Institution: ORNL/GA, GA
Date of shot: May 16, 2002
Analysis code(s): TRANSP, EFIT, GAPROFILES
Run number: 111221D14, EFIT05
Date of analysis: November 30, 2007
Assumption made for analysis:
      Data analysis mode with MSE kinetic EFITs (as opposed to j-evolution simulation)
      Used J_ECCD = 1.2 times value calculated by TORAY v0.97; NBCD with Df=0.3 m2/s
      Use basic NCLASS bootstrap model (no squeezing and potato orbit effects)
      Profile data 50-ms boxcar averaged; Convective coefficient of 2/3 used
      Single impurity - carbon assumed
      Corrected the problem of grho1=gxi on transp
   ** Unless otherwise noted, quoted rotation is for carbon impurity **
Shot description, purpose of the experiment:
      Integrated demonstrationof AT plasma sustainment using off-axis ECCD
  ionary discharge for ~2 s
      At t=3.700s, Zeff=2.03 and the average Z of impurities is Zimp=6.00
  (may include impurities other than the principle impurity).
