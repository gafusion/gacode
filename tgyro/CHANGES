Version 0.1

- Initial version of SSGKT code.

Version 0.2

- All occurrences of SSGKT/ssgkt renamed to TGYRO/tgyro including 
  directory structure.

Version 0.3

- Bare-bones code for local transport functionality.
- Simple thermonuclear source added.

Version 0.4

- Significant number of improvements.
- "driver" name convention changed to "tgyro". 
- INPUT_tgyro facility added.
- Management scripts largely rewritten.
- Global mode of operation now works.

Version 0.5 (unreleased)

- Added option to include Chang-Hinton neoclassical ion 
  flux to total flux (use TRANSP_NEO_ADD_FLAG=1).

Version 0.6 (14 April 2008)

- Renamed files in tgyro/src to loc_ and glo_ for local-specific 
  and global-specific code.
- LOCAL:
  = Major rewrite to include functioning local mode.
  = Parallelization scheme includes full local flexibility.
- GLOBAL:
  = Added option to hold density profile fixed (use 
    TRANSP_FIX_DENSITY_FLAG=1)

Version 0.7 (29 April 2008)

- LOCAL:
  = Newton-method improvements.
  = Now have GYRO and TGLF capability.
  = Fixes to MPI synchronization.
  = Many new LOC_* parameters.

Version 0.8 (11 July 2008)

- Removed batch/exec directories and now hook up directly to 
  those in GYRO by passing code and executables to scripts.
- LOCAL:
  = Now have NEO capability! 
  = Implemented experimental profile interface for local method.
    Set LOC_PROFILE_METHOD=2 to use.
  = Now have test mode (-t) working.  Should run with nproc equal
    to the number of code instances for this mode. 
  = Also introduced flag (LOC_LOCK_PROFILE_FLAG=1) to run GYRO
    once on fixed experimental profiles (no feedback).  This is 
    useful for running multiple local instances of GYRO at 
    a sequence of radii.
  = Added capability to overlay parameters in INPUT_tgyro onto 
    specific GYRO INPUT files. 
  = Restart capability added (specify with LOC_RESTART_FLAG=1).
  = Slight logic improvement in coding of iterative scheme.

Version 0.9 (11 August 2008)

- Now all comments refer to local method only.
- Added plotting of fluxes in real units.
- Added parameter LOC_DX_MAX to control maximum length of 
  Newton step.
- Slightly changed meaning of LOC_RELAX to control rate of 
  shortening of Newton step.

Version 1.0 (9 November 2008)

- Added capability to handle impurities.
- Added linear GYRO simulation mode.
- Added Chris' IDL plotting routines.
- TGLF is now bundled inside TGYRO rather than via a separate 
  subdirectory.
- QFM (Weiland model) now available via QFM in INPUT_tgyro.
- Wiki documentation brought up to date.
- Dramatic improvement of gyro_sub_* interfaces.
  = Aaron ... add comments here.
- Adiabatic electron capablity.
- Now pass z_eff and new shape parameters (zeta, zmag, etc) to GYRO.
- Iteration scheme now based on GYRO restarts rather than 
  new simulations from t=0.
- Better, more general, handling of loc_relax_iterations=0.
- Insertion of new interfaces for GYRO, NEO, TGLF and QFM into
  loc_flux.f90.
- NEO code used to compute neoclassical theory (rather than 
  old neoclassical theory subroutine).
- Fixed error in nu_exch formula (me Te + mi Ti -> mi Te + me Ti).
- Added rotation shear and z_eff to TLGF input.
- Removed examples directory from tgyro/tglf.

Version 1.1 

- HUGE number of modification in 1.1 (much is undocumented)
- Removed TGLF from TGYRO into separate CVS.
- Complete update of input templates.
- Finite-beta corrections now enabled in TGLF if LOC_BETAE_SCALE > 0.0.
- Impurities
  - Added species index to ti for possible inclusion on fast ions.
  - Can evolve ne in the presence of impurity ions, such that ion energy
    equation (for Ti) sums over main and impurity Qi.
- Fixed some I/O problems.
- Improve error-trapping and pass more error messages to run.out.
- Completely rewrote bin/tgyro script.   
- New iteration methods: serial and parallel blocked methods, 
  PPPL advanced iteration schemes (Luc Peterson).
- Added input capability for 5 ions with arbitrary mass/charge.
