This is a directory for python scripts for analyzing GYRO data based on
the python tools of numpy (numeric data structures), tables (HDF5
read/write), and matplotlib (plotting library and matlab like tools).

See also GA_ROOT/shared/vshdf5/README for general HDF5 information
as well.

The main scripts are:

readGyroH5.py
=============
This is for reading the gyro HDF5 files.  
The primary data structures are dictionaries where the
keys are the variable names.
readGyroH5.txt gives an example of using it via ipython


gyroMode2Real.py
================
This transform the gyro modes into real space

plotGyro.py
===========
Plot gyro data using HDF5

Older files that are deprecated
===============================
These files are geared towards the older
HDF5 layout, but kept because it shows the
types of plots we were playing around with.
  gyro_plotH5.py
  plot-gyro3D.py
