SINGLE TIMESTEP MODE:
 Run GYRO from the specified simulation directory for a single timestep only.  Useful to verify the Courant numbers are less than 1. Stores "run.out" information in "single.out".

      gyro_single -e <dir> -n <n_proc> [-p <path>]

      <dir>     Simulation directory.
 
      <n_proc>  Number of processors.

      <path>    Optional path to simdir of the form <path>/<dir>.
