	\section{Effect of Charge Exchange}
        \Large \boldmath
        The fast ion distribution function depends on the factor
                      $ P_{cx}(v) $,defined as the 
	probability that a fast ion survives charge exchange at least down
        to speed v,having been born at speed $v_b$ . 

	 \beq
           P_{cx}(v)=  exp\left(-\tau_s \int_{v}^{v_b}\frac{v^2dv}
              {(v^3+v_c^3)\tau_{cx}}\right) \label{eq1}
         \eeq
        Here $ \tau_{cx} $ is the mean time time between charge exchange
	collisions,
	\beq 
	   \tau_{cx}=\frac{1}{n\sigma v}
	\eeq
	and is normally assumed to be large so that $P_{cx}\approx 1 $.
	A somewhat better aproximation assumes that $\tau_{cx} $ is a constant,
	evaluated at some particular value of $v=v_0 $so that eq \ref{eq1} .
	becomes
	\beq
	    P_{cx}(v)=exp\left(-\frac{\tau_s}{\tau_{cx}(v_0)}\right)
	\eeq
	If $v_0$ is taken as the average speed that a fast ion has
	during the slowing down process in the abscence of charge exchange,
	\beq
	    v_0=\frac{\int\frac{v^3dv}{v^3+v_c^3}}{\int\frac{v^2dv}{v^3+v_c^3}}
	\eeq
	and the Freeman-Jones cross section for charge exchange 
	shown in Fig {\ref{Figps}} is used, the resulting survival probability
	is given as the dashed line in Fig{\ref{Figps}}. Shown  
	in Fig{\ref{Figps}} as the solid line is the exact result for
        this case,which assumes that the neutral density ,n,is fixed
         at $1 \cdot 10^8 cm^{-3} $.
         From the figure we may conclude that at neutral densities as low
	as $1\cdot10^8 cm^{-3} $ it is important to 
        include a refined charge exchange factor in the fast ion
	distribution function .

   \section{Input Description}

      Effect of charge exchange of fast ions with neutrals during the slowing
  down process is controlled by the integer valued switch $ifcx$ as follows: 

   \begin{tabular}{p{3cm}p{14cm}}
     $ ifcx \ge 0$ &          include the charge exchange effect in the fast 
	   ion distribution function in any volume element for which the local
	      mean time against charge exchange,$\tau_{cx}$, is related to the
	      local slowing down time,$\tau_s$,by
	       \beq
	         \tau_{cx} \leq  (ifcx)\tau_s
	       \eeq
	To always include charge exchange set $ifcx$ to a large number .
	(In the code any input value of  $ifcx \ge  ifcxmax (=10)$ means
	always (ie in all volume elements) include charge exchange. Note
	that setting $ifcx$ equal to 0 or a negative number means that
	charge exchange will be ignored.\\
     $ifcxmax$ &     a parameter 
	             that controls  \\
     $ennmin $ &     minimum neutral density,below which charge exchange will
                     be neglected .\\
   \end{tabular}

        ennmin if the local neutral density is less than
          $ ennmin $ then the effect of charge exchange will 
	($ifcxmax $ can be changed by a recompile of the code only)
