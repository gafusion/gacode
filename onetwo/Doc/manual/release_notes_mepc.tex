need at least three eqdsks to do spline interpolation in time
the input file to mepc takes #,; and ! as comment delimeters
you should really use 65x65 eqdsks but 33x65 will be interpolated onto 65x65 grid
if necessary
a maximum of 80 eqdsks can be used at oen time
.
MEPC.tcl is used to generate input list of eqdskis for mepc code
mepc code creates netcdf file from this list of eqdiskds
Onetwo reads netcdf file
MEPC.tcl can be used to run mepc code,with GUI selection of file names,etc.
Onetwo is told to read netcdf file setting some switches in inone
eqdisk list input to mepc can be editited manually,shots added,deleted(commented out),etc
to run mepc outside of MEPC.tcl do:
mepc eqdsklistfile netcdffile optionplotfilename
where eqdsklistfile is the list of eqdsks to use
netcdffile is the file to be created
optionplotfile is optional name of a plot output file (ie in cgm format)
use_eqdsk_contour and pol_flux_lim
.
