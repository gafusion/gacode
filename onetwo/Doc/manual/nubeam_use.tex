To use the nubeam package in \ot two input files are required. The first is the
so called ``namelist input file'' an example of such a file is  99411B11TR.DAT.
 This file supplies beam geometry info. The second required input file is the
2d ufile that supplies the  injected power,energy, and the full and half beam
current fractions as a function of time. 


The namelist input file is parsed to get the value of nbeams. This value is then
used  to allocate arrays. Apparently not all data in the namelist file is
consistent with this. (eg nbeams =4 but  xybapa(8) is often set for example). In
Onetwo we ignore such inconsistencies and generatre the input based on the value
of nbeam.
