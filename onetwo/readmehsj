changes made since CalTrans update


psivol(mf) =0 line removed from prenub in cray321.f
gauss_info.i parameter line moved after integer declaration line

removed rela *8 declaration of eps from beam_plot
removed integer ngauss declaration from subroutine beam_int (ngauss is
declared integer in gauss_info.i)
removed real *8 cxrat from function cxrat (duplicate declartaion since
cxrat is declared real *8 on definition line)

in nub4.i changed enbeam_tot_prev(kj) to enbeam_tot_prev
in common /nub4/

integer declaration of n_pulse removed from subroutine beam_init cray321.f
(n_pulse is declared integer in nub4.i)

integer declaration of kt removed from subroutine beam_init cray321.f
(kt  is declared integer in nub4.i)

 in subroutine beam_time_dependance removed beam_thermal_cutoff declaration
 (declared in nub4.i)

param.i changed (added notes)

subroutines rf_mhd_interface and rf_mhddat changed psi_rf(nw) 
to psi_rf(kpsi)
 
subroutine rf_mhddat changed sf_rf(nw) and qpsi_rf(nw) to
sf_rf(kpsi) and qpsi_rf(kpsi)


all of the above was added to CalTrans code 
and to my stand alone version 11/3/2000


added the  following in 2 palces in cray206.f
                       call STOP('ICSVKU fit of tdem data not available
     . in Onetwo',0)

also added the following in sub set_cdf_init
      if(intg_tdem(7) .eq. 2 ) then
         write (ncrt,'(" Subroutine SET_CDF_INIT detected an error:" /
     .                 " intg_tdem(7)  in file ",a,2x,i3 /
     .                 " The ICSVKU fitting option is not implemented",
     .                 " in the onetwo code")
         call STOP ('subroutine SET_CDF_INIT: method not available',241)
      endif
      if(intg_tdem(8) .eq. 2 ) then
         write (ncrt,'(" Subroutine SET_CDF_INIT detected an error:" /
     .                 " intg_tdem(7)  in file ",a,2x,i3 /
     .                 " The ICSVKU fitting option is not implemented",
     .                 " in the onetwo code")
         call STOP ('subroutine SET_CDF_INIT: method not available',241)
      endif

 
current drive:
switch ibcur and irfc are used in source to set source vector 
for Faradys law
s(kfar,1) is zero for bootstrap and driven (beam ,rf) currents at 
rho =0, HSJ 4/30/02
(lines that set s(kfar,1) are commented out
NOTE that n is in common in solcon.i
changed cray601.f so that if tot_iters > tot_iters_max then
frozen method is seleced immediately 05/09/02
modified curqo to use curdri instesad of curbi 5/11/02
in subroutine source
note that wneo(4,1),(4,2),(4,3) are not wired up to the bootstrap
model for jhirsh = 95,96
entry in       real*8 function tt2nhe4 (e)
was added(05/20/02) :  3000.0,      97.0 /   !fudged 3000,97 is made up HSJ (to accomodate iter)
but note that this value is a pure guess  to let iter_feat run
