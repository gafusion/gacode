!
!     nzeta controls gaussian integration over zeta.
!     this calculation is done once, at beginning of run ONLY.

      INTEGER, PARAMETER ::  nvtherml = 50 ! max points in thermal speed quadrature
      INTEGER, PARAMETER ::  nvfast   = 50 ! max points in fast ion      quadrature
!
!     nvtherml and nvfast is number of points in gaussian quadrature of
!     thermal and fast ion distributions. has to be done each time
!     neutron rate is evaluated. hence make these as small as possible
!     to gain speed.
