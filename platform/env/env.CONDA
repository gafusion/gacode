# The CONDA platform assumes that you have installed conda and run the
# appropriate commands to have conda set up well.  In the case of ITER,
# this involved 
#
# export PATH=/home/ITER/menghio/atom/miniconda2/bin:$PATH
# source activate /home/ITER/smiths/.conda/envs/gacode
#
# Note that this last command prompted me to run `conda init bash` (or simmilar)
# to setup my .bashrc to point to the appropriate conda environment, then logout
# and back in.
